# Project Title: AI-Powered League of Legends Coach and Analysis Tool

## Objective

Develop a robust and innovative League of Legends coaching and analysis application using OpenAI GPT, OpenAI Functions, OpenAI Assistants & Threads and integrated with RiotGames API directly or an API Wrapper for the League of Legends API.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Retrieval and Storage

Use a wrapper or interface directly with Riot Games' League of Legends API.
Retrieve and store extensive player data, including playstyle, performance history, champion proficiency, match history, and detailed match statistics.
Store data in a structured database for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## Player Data Analysis

### Implement Data Analysis Tiers

Tier 1: Direct API stats (match history, champion played, match duration, win/loss, KDA, team composition, gold earned, damage, etc.).
Tier 2: Calculated stats (average KDA, most played champions, win/loss ratio, CS/min, etc.).
Tier 3: AI-driven analytics (prediction rates, custom ELO rankings, playstyle analysis, tips, and tricks, advanced calculations and models).

### Benchmark Database

Build databases profiling top players globally for each champion and role, similar to the data collection for the user.

### User Interaction

Develop a system to input and retrieve summoner names and regions, both for the user and top players.
Implement a conversational AI coach that can recall previous interactions and track user progress.
Allow users to query their recent matches and receive insights and analyses.

### Reporting and Visualization

Enable the AI to create and present graphs, charts, and progress reports.
Ensure these visualizations are easily interpretable and visually appealing.

## Innovative Features and Enhancements

Suggest and implement creative features and functionalities that enhance the user experience and provide unique insights into gameplay and improvement areas.
Continuously refine and update the tool based on the latest AI technologies and gaming trends.

## Technical Specifications

Languages/Frameworks: Python (for AI and data analysis), PostgreSQL for database management system.
APIs: Utilize Riot Games' League of Legends API for data collection. Ensure proper usage of any API wrapper wrapper methods and endpoints.
AI Implementation: Use OpenAI's GPT models for conversational AI and advanced data analysis.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interaction with the AI coach, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
Data Visualization Tools: Integrate tools like D3.js or Chart.js for dynamic data visualization.

### Development Considerations

Ensure the application is scalable, maintainable, and secure.
Implement error handling and data validation to maintain data integrity and reliability.
Adhere to best coding practices and document the code thoroughly for future maintenance and upgrades.
