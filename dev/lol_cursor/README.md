# Overview

Given the project description, we need to create a structured and modular application that interacts with the Riot Games API, manages a PostgreSQL database, and provides a web interface for data visualization and analysis. Here's a reasoned breakdown of the source code files we'll need, considering the dependencies and logical order of creation:

1. **Database Interface (Database Class)**: This will be the foundation for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. It should handle connection management, query execution, and dynamic table creation.

- `database.py`

2. **Riot API Wrapper (RiotAPI Class)**: This class will encapsulate all interactions with the Riot Games API, fetching data such as summoner information, champion mastery, and match details. It's crucial to have this before we can populate the database with data from the Riot Games API.

- `riot_api_wrapper.py`

3. **Data Population Script**: A script that leverages both the RiotAPI class and the Database class to populate the database with player lists, match lists, and detailed match analyses. This script is essential for initially populating the database with relevant data.

- `data_population_script.py`

4. **FastAPI Web Server**: The core of the application, responsible for handling requests and delivering data. It will need to implement CORS middleware and connect to the database interface.

- `main.py`

5. **Feature Implementation Files**: Based on the key features described, we'll need several files to implement the functionality. These files will depend on the Database class, RiotAPI wrapper, and the FastAPI setup.

- `summoner_data.py` (Summoner Data Retrieval)
- `champion_mastery.py` (Champion Mastery Information)
- `league_info.py` (League Information)
- `match_data.py` (Match Data Processing)
- `player_performance.py` (Player Performance Calculation)
- `background_data_population.py` (Background Data Population)

6. **Scheduling Mechanism**: For real-time data updates, we'll need a scheduler to periodically refresh our database with the latest data.
   - `scheduler.py`
7. **Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning Models**: To predict match outcomes and offer champion recommendations.

- `analytics.py`
- `machine_learning_models.py`

8. **User Authentication**: To secure the application and provide personalized experiences.

- `authentication.py`

9. **Interactive Dashboard**: A dynamic web dashboard for visualizing performance metrics and match histories.

- `dashboard.py`

10. **API Rate Limiting**: To manage load and prevent API abuse on our FastAPI server.

- `rate_limiting.py`
